# Coding Riddles

Welcome to the Coding Riddles project! This project aims to create a website dedicated to coding riddles, similar to coding games but focused solely on riddles.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide a platform where users can solve coding riddles and receive immediate feedback on their solutions. Riddles are often challenging to explain and validate, making it difficult to know if your solution is correct. This project aims to resolve that issue by offering a system that can accurately validate and provide feedback on riddle solutions.

## Features

- A collection of coding riddles of varying difficulty levels.
- An interface for users to submit their solutions and receive instant validation.
- Detailed explanations and hints for each riddle to aid in understanding and solving them.
